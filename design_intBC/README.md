# Design of integration barcodes:

1. The output of this integration barcode design could be found in: /design_probes/References/PETS_orthoSeq_targets.xlsx, as it is the input for the intBC probe design.
2. Specifically, most of the nupack tasks was not run inside of the jupyter. Instead, it was submitted as slurm scripts with the type of code provided in the example jupyter notebooks.
3. Cross-hybridization was done in a pairwise manner, which leads to one specific tube_analysis file generated by nupack.
